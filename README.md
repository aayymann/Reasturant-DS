The program will receive a list of orders as input. This list represents the scenario to be simulated. For each order, 
the system will receive the following information:
- Arrival Time Stamp: When the order was made. - Order Type: There are 3 types of orders: VIP orders, Frozen orders and Normal orders.
• VIP orders must be serviced first before frozen and normal orders.
• Frozen orders are the orders that needs to be delivered using motorcycles with refrigerators (Frozen Motorcycles) to keep its temperature.
• Normal orders are the orders that neither VIP nor Frozen.
- Order Region: the restaurant has 4 branches. Each branch is in a different region. The Order Region indicates the region of 
the order and hence the branch that should deliver the order to the customer.
- Order Distance: the distance between the restaurant and the order location (in meters).
- Order Money: the total order money the customer should pay.

- Motorcycle Type: There are 3 types: Fast motorcycles, Frozen motorcycles and Normal motorcycles.
• Fast motorcycles are motorcycles with higher speed level.
• Frozen motorcycles are the motorcycles that have small refrigerator to save food in.
• Normal motorcycles are the motorcycles that neither Fast nor Frozen.
- Motorcycle Region: the branch or the region of this motorcycle (from which the motorcycle starts its delivery and to which it returns after delivery).
- The Motorcycle speed (the number of meters it can move in one timestep) is the same for all motorcycles of the same type.

In this project i implemented Lists, Qeues,Priority Qeues and Linked lists from strach and and assigned each of them with their sutabile objec to 
achieve the pirpose of the project.
